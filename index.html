                    I was born and raised in Glenview Illinois. My parents were born in South Korea and moved
                    to
                    America before I was born so
                    that makes me a Korean-American. I've visited Korea
                    a couple times and I would say Seoul, South Korea is my favorite place in the world. I used to have
                    hopes of teaching english
                    there when I graduated from university but unfortunately, I am a dual citizen, so if I stay in
                    Korea
                    longer than 90 days, I would
                    have to declare residency and that would mean I would be elligible to be drafted into the Korean
                    army.

                    Pertaining to my education, I went to Marquette University and graduated with a mechanical
                    engineering
                    degree. The semester before
                    I graduated, I took an intro to coding class and discovered how much enjoyment I got out of coding.
                    So
                    post graduation, when I stumbled
                    upon an opportunity to apply for a coding bootcamp at Northwestern University, I couldn't let that
                    chance go. I applied and got accepted.
                    Now I'm pursuing a certificate in coding at Northwestern University and hope to combine both my
                    degree
                    in Engineering and my certificate
                    in coding to create a fulfilling future for myself.
